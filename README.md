# OrderApiCaseStudy

A simple but complete .NET REST API for managing café orders – designed and built as a standalone application to demonstrate clean API architecture, data persistence, and background processing using message queues.

---

## Features

- Create a new order (with customer name, items, total price, etc.)
- View all orders or a specific one by ID
- Process payments (mark as paid or cancelled) via background service
- Order consists of:
  - Order number (autogenerated)
  - Customer name (person or company)
  - Creation date
  - Order status (New / Paid / Cancelled)
  - Order items:
    - Product name
    - Quantity
    - Price per item

---

## Data Storage

- Data is stored using EF Core with InMemory database (can be easily swapped for SQLite or SQL Server)
- Includes basic validation (e.g. no order without items)

---

## Payment Processing

- Payment updates are handled asynchronously using a message queue and background worker
- Payments affect order status:
  - `true` → status changes to **Paid**
  - `false` → status changes to **Cancelled**

---

## REST API and Swagger

- Swagger UI available at `/swagger`
- **⚠️ Note:** The default Swagger-generated JSON for creating an order does not work properly.
- Please use the following valid JSON example when testing via Swagger:

{
  "customerName": "Testovací zákazník",
  "createdAt": "2025-05-05T10:00:00Z",
  "status": 0,
  "items": [
    {
      "productName": "Testovací produkt 1",
      "quantity": 2,
      "unitPrice": 19.99
    }
  ]
}
